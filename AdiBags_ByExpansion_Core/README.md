# AdiBags: By Expansion (Core)

This is an extension to the World of Warcraft addon "Adibags" which adds further grouping by which expansion an item belongs to.

## Decisions

- "Pre-patch" items belong to the expansion which they preceed.
- Items belong to the expansion of their content not necessarily the patch added
  * eg, an item added in patch 3.x (wrath) to drop from a WoW mob would be classed as WoW not wrath.
